<li><strong>Scenary:</strong> low poly geometries and low saturation of colors to set up a game-like world.</li><li><strong>Music:</strong> absolute music which suit the scenary. </li></ol><ul>
<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> some rigid bodies, adopt the features of the scenery, are rising up, falling down and transforming their shapes suddenly. </li><li><strong>Energy Cube:</strong> a stray of diamond-like cubes, which is used to show players the direction. </li><li><strong>Zigzag:</strong> a solid-colored bar controlled by the player.</li></ul><h3 id="interaction-&amp;-gameplay"><a name="interaction-&amp;-gameplay" href="#interaction-&amp;-gameplay"></a>Interaction &amp; Gameplay</h3><ul>
<li>Single Player Mode</li></ul><p>This game consists of various levels with their own <strong>scenary</strong>, where the <strong>zigzag</strong> grows with 45 degree naturely, and players are asked to switch the direction of growth between left and right by tapping screen following the rhythm of the <strong>music</strong> to bypass <strong>obstacles</strong>. Once the <strong>zigzag</strong> impacts the <strong>obstcales</strong>, it declares that you fail. In each level, everytime players pass a 1/4 of the journey, the game progress would be saved and you have 5 chances to restart from the saving points.</p><ul>
<li>Dual Player Mode</li></ul><p>In dual player mode, you can compete with firends or online players and both players’ <strong>zigzags</strong> would be showed. The longer living one wins.</p><h3 id="critical-analysis"><a name="critical-analysis" href="#critical-analysis"></a>Critical Analysis</h3><ul>
<li>The Intention of Designers </li></ul><p>The game designers intented to create different levels with different symbolic significances by combining <strong>scenary</strong> with <strong>music</strong>. And they aims at making their intended audiences, who like to play as an conductor, prejudge the path by following the rhythm. </p><p>Sadly, the failure of giving players accurate hits to follow the rhythm makes players confused whether to follow the visual hints or to trust the rhythm. With this puzzle, the difficulty of this game increased unjustifiably. The visual and audio hope to relax players, but the requirements of passing without errors would always end up the journey in the middle way which will give the players more pressure on contrary. What’s more? The hardness between levels are not designed progressively for new hands to master. </p><ul>
<li>Is The Game Replayable?</li></ul><p>Actually, it’s a relaxing game but the lack of some features unable to attract players to play again. Compared with Monument Valley, the most frustrating part of this game is the lack of story. The only purpose, passing each level, will make the players get bored quickly. Furthermore, different potential paths with different degrees of diffculty would give players more reasons to replay.  </p><ul>
<li>Conclusion</li></ul><p>To conclude, the visual and audio of the game is fantastic, but some flaws make the game not as fasinanting as it can be. If the story of the game, the harmony between <strong>music</strong> and <strong>zigzag‘s</strong> actions and the multi-path play can be perfect, the game will have greater achievement.  </p>
